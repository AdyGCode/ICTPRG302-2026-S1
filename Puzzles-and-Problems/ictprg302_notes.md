I'm writing these worksheets to the Cert IV Programmers, but ICTPRG302 is a Level 3 unit.

AQF says level 3 is:
- to qualify individuals who apply a broad range of knowledge and skills in varied contexts to undertake skilled work
- expressed as knowledge, skills and the application of knowledge and skills specified in the level 3 criteria
- complete routine activities
- provide and transmit solutions to predictable and sometimes unpredictable problems

"Graduates at this level will apply knowledge and skills to demonstrate autonomy and judgement and to take limited responsibility in known and stable contexts within established parameters."

> I think that this means we can give students "todo stubs", design documents, and acceptance criteria, like, really business analysis everything to death, and leave them with pure requirements.
> A cert 3 should be able to handle unambiguous requirements.


Contrast level 4:
"Graduates at this level will apply knowledge and skills to demonstrate autonomy, judgement and limited responsibility in known or changing contexts and within established parameters."
