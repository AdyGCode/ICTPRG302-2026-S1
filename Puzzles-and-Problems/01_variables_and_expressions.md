# 🐍 01: Variables, expressions, comparisons

---

## Introduction:
Each problem below is designed to help you practice basic Python skills.
You'll use variables, input/output, arithmetic, and comparisons. Write your code in your chosen Python and test each one.

Keep PEP8 in mind and make your code easy to read with meaningful variable names.

> Remember: code that you haven't run or tested is not trustworthy!

## Input; output; variables; arithmetic

> [!Note]
> At this point, you're still getting used to datatypes.
> You can always check the type of a variable using the `type()` function.
> Recall that `input()` always returns a string value.

> [!Reference]
> `input()`: Waits for the program user to input some text, finishes when they press "enter"
> `int()`: Turns a variable into an integer (or tries to)
> `str()`: Turns a variable into a string
> `float()`: Turns a variable into a floating-point number
> `print()`: Outputs text to the console
>
> String concatenation can be done by `+` adding strings together.
> Note well that string concatenation will fail if you mix datatypes. Consider the above functions as hints.

### 1. Greet the User
Ask the user for their name and print a greeting message.

### 2. Add Two Numbers
Ask the user for two numbers and print their sum.

### 3. Subtract Two Numbers
Ask the user for two numbers and print the result of subtracting the second from the first.

### 4. Multiply Two Numbers
Ask the user for two numbers and print their product.

### 5. Divide Two Numbers
Ask the user for two numbers and print the result of dividing the first by the second.

### 6. Calculate Area of a Rectangle
Ask for width and height, then print the area.

### 7. Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
Ask for a temperature in Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit using the formula:
`Fahrenheit = (Celsius x 9/5) + 32`

### 8. Convert Kilometers to Miles
Ask for a distance in kilometers and convert it to miles.
> NB: 1 kilometer = 0.621371 miles.

### 9. Simple Interest Calculator
Ask for principal, rate, and time, then calculate simple interest:
`Interest = (Principal x Rate x Time) / 100`

### 10. Calculate the Square of a Number
Ask for a number and print its square.

### 11. Calculate the Cube of a Number
Ask for a number and print its cube.

### 12. Calculate the Average of Three Numbers
Ask for three numbers and print their average.
> Remember that an average is the sum of all the numbers divided by how many there are.

### 13. Swap Two Variables
Ask for two values and swap them using a third variable.

## Comparisons

### 14. Check if Two Numbers Are Equal
Ask for two numbers and print whether they are equal.

### 15. Compare Two Numbers
Ask for two numbers and print which one is greater.

### 16. Check if a Number is Positive
Ask for a number and print whether it is positive.

### 17. Check if a Number is Negative
Ask for a number and print whether it is negative.

### 18. Check if a Number is Zero
Ask for a number and print whether it is zero.

### 19. Check if a Number is Greater Than 100
Ask for a number and print whether it is greater than 100.

### 20. Check if a Number is Evenly Divisible by Another
Ask for two numbers and print whether the first is divisible by the second.
> Hint: don't forget the `%` modulo operator.
